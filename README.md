# Safe C++ Smart Pointers Wrapper

The "Lumi" project goal is to provide tools for writing safe and efficient code.
This `lumi-safe-ptr` library provides C++ smart pointers wrappers that makes
them even more safe to use.

While C++ smart pointers help a lot in writing memory safe code - they still
have some pitfalls and problems that users can mistakenly fall into. These are
the issues that `lumi-safe-ptr` library solves:

  * The infamous [`shared_ptr` circular reference issue](
    #avoid-shared_ptr-circular-references)
  * More [planned in the future...](#future-work)

## Installation and Usage

This is a header-only library with a single header file located in
[include/lumi-safe-ptr.hpp](include/lumi-safe-ptr.hpp).
This file can be simply downloaded and included by
`#include "lumi-safe-ptr.hpp"`. All macros start with `LUMI_` prefix and all
other symbols are inside `lumi::` namespace.

## Avoid shared_ptr circular references

This is the most known `shared_ptr` issue that is now avoidable ðŸ˜ƒ.

It can be solved using macros `LUMI_CYCLE_CHECK` and `LUMI_STRONG_PTR` that will
raise a compilation error when a circular reference is detected. Their usage is
simple:

1. Every `shared_ptr` member in a type should be declared using
   `LUMI_STRONG_PTR(type) name;` (instead of `std::shared_ptr<type> name;`).
2. Before Every type that uses `LUMI_STRONG_PTR` add (in the global scope)
   `LUMI_CYCLE_CHECK(type, pointed_types...)`

For example:
```c++
#include "lumi-safe-ptr.hpp"

LUMI_CYCLE_CHECK(module::A, module::B, module::C)

namespace module {

class A {
    LUMI_STRONG_PTR(B) b;
    LUMI_STRONG_PTR(C) c;
};

}
```

## Future Work

More Issues that may be solved next as long as they can be technically done
using C++ syntax:

1. Access moved `unique_ptr`
2. Using unchecked `weak_ptr`
3. Deleting the raw pointers
4. Thread safety
5. Using non-heap pointers
6. Not using `make_shared`
7. Safe arrays of pointers
8. Derived to base class pointer
9. Garbage collecting pointer
